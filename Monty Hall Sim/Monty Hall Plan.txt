# Plan for Task2

1. Requirements:
    Allow user to input switch or no switch
    Simulate game (with user choice) 100,000 times
    Print results as percentage (which should be 33.33% for keeping and 66.66% for switching)

2. System Analysis:
    INPUTS:
        random number between 1 and 3 for your choice
        random number between 1 and 3 for computer choice (winning choice)
        random number between 1 and 3 that != comp rand or user rand
        whether user will switch
    OUTPUTS:
        "Open the door", eliminating one option that is not the winning door
        Execute user switch or not switch
        count # of wins

3. System Design:
    Identify winning number
        Identify goatsOne
        Identify goatsTwo
    Identify user choice number
    Define switch/not switch conditions
        user = winner
        user = goatOne
        user = goatTwo
    Count number of times user = winner AFTER switch
    Divide number of win by 100,000 to calculate percentage
    print results

4. Implementation:

5. Testing:
    a. INPUT: 'S'; 'y'
       OUTPUT: 66.66% winning rate; simulation restarts
        - This one was tricky. Initially 's' and 'S' would return different values. Once I formatted\
          he user's input to always be lowercase these issues were resolved
    b. INPUT: 'k'; no
       OUTPUT: 33.33%; "Curse you Perry the Platypus!"
       - Output was correct. The percentage is +-0.2% but I believe that is within the margin of error
